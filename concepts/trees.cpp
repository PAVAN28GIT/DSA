// binary tree : each node has max 2 children

// types :

// 1. full bt : each node has either 0 or 2

// 2. complete bt : all levels are completely filled except for the last level.. and in the last level all nodes shld be towards left only..

// 3. perfect bt : all leaf nodes are at same level

// 4. balanced bt : height of tree at max log2 (N) , n is no of nodes. ------> ( height(left) - height(right) <=1)

// 5. degenerate bt : stright tree like linked list
